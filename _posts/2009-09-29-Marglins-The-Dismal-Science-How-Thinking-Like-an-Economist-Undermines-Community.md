I just read Stephen A. Marglin’s [The Dismal Science: How Thinking Like an Economist Undermines Community](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/MARDIS.html). He questions some fundamental assumptions of mainstream economic theory and makes the case for a more humane understanding of society. I found a great part of the book really interesting but I’m missing a conclusive ending. Anyway, here’s my personal summary in keywords which neither claims to be comprehensive nor one hundred per cent accurate.

### 1.

- individual vs. community -\> tension: good, healthy, creative\
 - community is important to a good and meaningful life

### 2.

community (as opposed to ‘just’ association): asks for loyalty, commitment, identity\
 -\> not easy to opt out. leaving the community must come at a cost, otherwise it is vulnerable to centrifugal forces that often are irresistible.\
 -\> diametrically opposed to the idea of market agents with set preferences that are free to choose

- communities of necessity (the poor have to band together) are endangered by prosperity\
 - communities of affinity (family, religious communities)

examples of community:\
 - Amish barn raising. insurances undermines mutual dependence of the villagers and thus community\
 - care for the elderly and sick. now nurses/professional health care

markets undermine community\
 - markets push for expansion/competition/rivalry -\> efficiency is the only measurement\
 - impersonal market relations replace personal ties, undermine reciprocity, altruism, mutual obligations

### 3.

- ideology of modernity:

four assumptions in economic theory:\
 - individuals: have given/fixed/unchanging preferences, are rational, calculating, self-interested\
 - privileging algorithmic over experimental knowledge\
 - nation-state: only legitimate social grouping.\
 - unlimited wants

-\> Marglin challenges those ‘myths’: foundational critique

### 4.

individualism in economics is a very different kind of individualism than in other fields:\
 - given preferences: individual doesn’t get influenced by its environment. idea is also opposed to self-realization\
 - universal agency: act without coercion\
 - radical subjectivism: there is no judge beyond the individual of his preferences\
 - self-interest: it is a circular argument that everything an individual does is by self-interest, otherwise it wouldn’t do it. so it makes sense to define ‘self-interest’ in narrow terms (non-altruistic etc.)

- holism as a different way to look at the world

### 5.

what gave rise to modernity?\
 - loss of community is an unavoidable byproduct of a growing economy/increasing standard of living, or isn’t it?or is it about distribution (landlords pushing enclosure to save their fading power)

### 6.

- the rise of the idea that if all individuals act in their self-interest, this is best for society as a whole

### 7. / 8.

- algorithmic knowledge: can be written down, logically calculated\
 - experimental knowledge: rooted in one’s own experience as well as trust in the accounts of others (parents-child, master-apprentice), therefore rooted in community

### 9.

(- bosses get their share of the pie only for knowing how to assemble all the parts and keeping this knowledge to themselves)\
 - economic theory doesn’t take experimental knowledge seriously: cannot model real people\
 -\> economics as a mathematical science (algorithmic knowledge) heaves it above politics and withdraws it from political debate/democracy.

### 10.

- economists are responsible for growing the pie (whatever the cost), politicians for (re-)distributing it.\
 - nation-state legitimizes this

### 11.

modernity:

-   possibility of abundance as close as never before because of increased efficiency/productivity
-   impossibility of abundance because of unlimited wants
    -   relative wants:
        -   economic rivalry (having more stuff than the Joneses). wealth is now the dominating factor in defining people
        -   believe in infinite growth as a non-zero-sum game (everybody wins as the pie keeps growing) makes it a common goal

    -   absolute needs:
        -   in an individualistic world-view new goods and stuff substitute for personal relations
        -   as long as good health is a commodity, and med-tech keeps improving, it will remain scarce

-\> we cannot rethink society when we have reached ‘enough’. rather, we shall have enough when we rethink society.

### 12.

fair trade as an imagined community between producers and consumers

### 13.

dominant views:\
 - culture doesn’t exist, everybody thinks like a homo economics (a ‘modern’ individual)\
 - western culture is superior, ‘developing countries’ need to catch up and become ‘modern’

- but people can keep (and further develop) their cultures while modern technology is being introduced\
 - individualism vs. holism: rights of individuals (liberty, autonomous and algorithmic decision-making) vs. rights of communities (experimental knowledge: tradition, spirituality)\
 - nation vs. other communities

The author of [Virtual reality: a new creative medium where the default state is belief
](http://cdixon.org/2015/01/24/virtual-reality-a-new-creative-medium-where-the-default-state-is-belief) argues that the concept of _suspension of disbelief_ won’t apply to virtual reality, since the default state in VR will be belief.

I disagree. _Suspension of disbelief_ is not inherent to any medium like TV or VR, but rather it is inherent to any kind of narration. We tend to be suspicious of the content of stories strangers tell us—no matter the medium. Indeed, [Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief):

> _Suspension of disbelief_ or _willing suspension of disbelief_ is a term coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who suggested that if a writer could infuse a “human interest and a semblance of truth” into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative.

Also, 1817 was before television, and even radio, were invented.

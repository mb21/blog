I can see [Oculus-style VR](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/why-oculus-sees-virtual-reality-as-the-final-compute-platform/) (virtual reality) for two things: gaming, and calling your loved ones when they are in another country. Beyond that, I just don’t think it will catch on. But AR (augmented reality) — placing virtual objects or information in your view of the real world — should be awesome.

Google Glass currently basically offers little more than a [picture-in-picture for life](http://phandroid.com/2013/05/08/what-can-you-see-and-do-with-google-glass-video/) and I suppose that’s what it will remain for the foreseeable future. It’s the best current technology can do.

But imagine glasses that contain displays on each lens (for virtual stereoscopic 3D-vision) which are completely transparent for the most part. Then you can [superimpose select virtual objects](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/05/augmented-reality-tank-can-blast-holes-in-real-surfaces/) or information (labels, directions, virtual whiteboards, telepresent people) to seamlessly integrate the virtual into the physical world and have the advantages of both.

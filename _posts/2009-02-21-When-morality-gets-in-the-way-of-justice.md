This [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html) tries to explain the different views that political conservatives and liberals have on issues of justice and morality. Jonathan Haidt thinks that humans have five innate psychological systems that are the foundations of their moral views.

1.  Harm/care
2.  Fairness/reciprocity
3.  Ingroup/loyalty
4.  Authority/respect
5.  Purity/sanctity

Liberals have moral intuitions primarily based upon the ﬁrst two foundations, and therefore misunderstand the moral motivations of conservatives, who generally rely upon all ﬁve foundations.

This explains why conservatives emphasize *stability* and *order* (and thus promote *tradition* and institutions like the *state, family*, and*church*) while liberals are usually more *progressive* and promote *individual freedom* even if this means radical change and may threaten society as we know it.

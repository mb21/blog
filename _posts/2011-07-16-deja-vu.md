I hate that feeling. You look at something or hear a story and then you go on to other stuff while somewhere in the back of your mind you keep thinking about what you just heard or saw. And then, suddenly it strikes you that you might have heard or seen this before, you feel like this wasn’t the first time you heard that story or watched that video. But now it’s already too late. It’s impossible to tell with certainty whether you really had experienced this before and remembered only after contemplating a few minutes the just experienced or whether this was actually the first time and this experience has already become entangled with similar memories of the past, up to the point where you cannot tell anymore whether it is a fresh memory or just a refreshed memory.

*Déjà vu*, as they say…

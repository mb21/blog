Generally, I’m a very technology-friendly person. But strangely enough I’m sometimes quite slow in adopting new technologies when it isn’t immediately obvious to me at first sight in what way they might benefit me personally. Mobile phone? No, I have one at home. Tabbed browsing? No, I have Exposé on Mac OS X. RSS-feed reader? No, I have bookmarks in my browser. Now I use all those mentioned. But I still refuse to use some stuff like multiple Desktops (aka Spaces) or digital television (I watch video mostly on my computer anyway) for example.

Now, look at this. I have a blog! I’m still not quite sure what I’m gonna use it for, but it stroke me that I might as well put some of my notes and thoughts on the Internet instead of my local harddisk. As they accumulate over the years, maybe somebody will find at least one of them interesting… ;-)

Another thing that held me back is that I’m cautious about letting too much information about my personal life slip loose on the internet. Call me paranoid if you feel better then, but the [semantic web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) is coming (sooner or later and in one form or another). And when it’s fully arrived I’m not sure whether I’d appreciate that people might be able to find out just about everything about me by typing my name into semantic Google. So that’s why I don’t write my full name here.

Yet another thing: I don’t like having my data hosted by a company that doesn’t allow me (or others for that matter) to re-download it again (like it’s the case on YouTube). Neither do I like having my data stored in some kind of proprietary file format that I might not be able to read in ten years because I won’t have the software (or the computer to run the old software on). That’s why I’m very glad that WordPress is open source software and that wordpress.com allows my posts to be exported as XML-files.

So, I might just getting starting now… ;-)

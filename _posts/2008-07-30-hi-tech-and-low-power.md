Well, I feel like all humanity (not only the US) has to solve this problem (and most other problems, too) together. But besides that, I think he’s right. we need to make the problem of climate change a positive challenge.

I wanna make a sci-fi story/film/whatever that shows people having succeeded in this challenge. I wanna show a world that is both *hi tech* and *low power/energy*. In opposition to Wikipedia’s description of Cyberpunk as *hi tech, low living*, I wanna show a society that maintains a high living standard with the help of hi tech and avoids messing up the whole planet, because this hi tech is so smart and efficient that it can do without much energy (or is able to recycle it to a large extent). The little energy that is indeed needed should be renewable and is gained decentralized.

I hope I get around to doing that story one day…
